# Card Hand Widget

Provides the `CardHand` class for rendering a fully interactive fan of cards with hover states, dragging, and selection callbacks; create it with a root element and options. By default the widget mounts itself as a fullscreen overlay, centering the hand and drawing cards directly over the interface without any framing chrome.
